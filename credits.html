						I, Shresth Singh, X-E, would like to express my gratitude for my CA teacher, Ms. Arpita Upadhyay who gave me the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic Cultures of different States, which also helped me in doing a lot of research and I came to know about so many new things. I am thankful to my parents for always being there at my aid. I also take this opportunity to thank my friends for sharing their valuable ideas and time with me to help me complete this project within the limited time frame.  I am really grateful to all of them. I had a fabulous time working on this project.
